// The react-grid-layout host (Phase E of the UI re-architecture, issue #73; RFC
// §3.3 + Decision 2), with the PER-PAGE BOUNDED no-scroll fit from the operator's
// root-cause architecture pass. This is the component half of the layout engine:
// it takes the placed widgets, renders them through the registry inside RGL's
// Responsive grid, and at the fit breakpoint PAGINATES them like a phone home
// screen — NEVER scrolling. All the load-bearing MATH (the page partition, the
// fill-the-page rowHeight derivation, the tile-can't-straddle-a-page repair, the
// per-page rebase) lives in lib/layoutEngine.ts (pure, unit-tested); this
// component only wires RGL + a ResizeObserver to those functions.
//
// THE FIT MODEL (issue #73 root-cause fix — each page is its OWN bounded grid):
//   • The available band is measured ONCE: availH = viewportH − gridTop −
//     pagerH (− the pinned strip's height when shown). gridTop is the grid
//     container's real getBoundingClientRect().top, which folds chrome + page
//     padding + the gap into one DPI-independent CSS-pixel number. pagerH is the
//     pager element's OWN measured height (issue #73 polish — see below), not a
//     guessed constant, so the pager is always reserved exactly and stays fully
//     visible inside the pinned (overflow-hidden) viewport.
//   • computePageFit derives (R, rowHeight) from that band: R is the design
//     rows-per-page (a 2×2 of charts → 2*CHART_ROWS), reduced only if the band is
//     too short to give R rows a readable height; rowHeight = (availH −
//     (R+1)*margin)/R so EXACTLY R rows fill availH → no scroll.
//   • VIEW MODE renders ALL pages as full-width SLIDES in a horizontal track
//     (translateX(−activePage*100%) with a CSS transition — a phone-home-screen
//     SIDE-SCROLL, issue #73 polish #2), inside an overflow-hidden viewport. Each
//     slide is STILL its own viewport-HEIGHT bounded grid: that page's placements
//     REBASED to local y=0, in an RGL of height exactly availH with maxRows = R.
//     There is NO clip window and NO vertical translate: a tile cannot be sheared
//     at a page boundary because each slide IS its own grid that exactly fits. The
//     pager (prev/next + dots) drives activePage → the track slides horizontally.
//   • CUSTOMIZE MODE renders the FULL canvas (all pages stacked) with vertical
//     scroll + page-boundary guides, so every widget on every page is reachable
//     and a tile can be dragged down past a boundary onto a later page; on save
//     each tile's page comes from its `y` (clampToPages keeps it straddle-free).
//   • PINNED STAT STRIP (default on): the stat cards render in their OWN editable
//     RGL grid pinned above the paged slide-track (always visible, not paged; the
//     strip is identical on every page). Its placements ride the same layout blob
//     under a reserved key (no schema change) and it's drag/resize-arrangeable in
//     Customize mode just like the page grid. Toggle it off and the stats become
//     ordinary tiles that page with the rest.
//   • Below the fit breakpoint (mobile / md): UNCHANGED — a fixed rowHeight, the
//     page scrolls normally, NO pager.

  // container's real top via getBoundingClientRect().top folds the chrome height,
  // the page padding AND the gap into one number, so `available = viewportH −

  // ---- RGL change handler ----

  // edited lg grid back over the pinned stats' saved placements (we don't want to
  // drop their geometry — the user may unpin later). Below fit, the grid is the
  // whole set so we persist as-is.
  //
  // THE INFINITE-LOOP FIX (issue #73). RGL fires `onLayoutChange` not just on a
  // genuine user drag/resize but on mount, breakpoint switch, vertical compaction,
  // AND every time we feed it a new `layouts` prop. Persisting from THAT handler
  // formed a feedback loop: persist → optimistic state update → re-feed RGL →
  // `onLayoutChange` → persist … . It never settled because RGL's vertical
  // compaction of an overlap-carrying layout can OSCILLATE between two equally-
  // valid packings (a 2-cycle, not a fixed point), so each re-emit genuinely
  // differs from the last → endless persists → React #185 ("maximum update depth
  // exceeded"). The robust break (how RGL apps normally persist): persist ONLY on
  // the actual user gestures — RGL's `onDragStop` / `onResizeStop` (and the
  // explicit add/remove paths) — never on the noisy `onLayoutChange`. So we use
  // `onLayoutChange` purely to CAPTURE the latest full layout into a ref (no
  // setState, no persist), and the stop handlers persist from that ref. A
  // structural-equality guard stays as a cheap belt-and-suspenders no-op filter.
