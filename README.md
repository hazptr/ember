A self-hosted dashboard for your **National Grid (US)** electricity & gas account.
It logs into `myaccount.nationalgrid.com`, pulls your **entire** bill + usage history,
stores it in Postgres, and gives you charts of usage, cost (supply vs delivery),
effective **rates** ($/kWh, $/therm), and a usage-vs-weather view — plus every bill
PDF. It re-checks automatically as your next bill approaches, and has a manual
**"Check for new bills"** button.

> Works for any National Grid US region (Upstate NY, Metro NY, MA, RI) — your region
> and company code are detected automatically from your account.

## Features

- **Full history, automatically.** Logs in once, reuses the session, and pulls your
  **entire** bill + usage history and every bill PDF — then keeps itself current.
- **Cost done right.** Supply vs delivery, effective **rates** ($/kWh, $/therm), and a
  trailing-12-month all-in average — all sourced from the bill **PDF's Total Current
  Charges**, not the API's (carryover-inflated) Amount Due.
- **Weather & degree-days.** Full bill-history temperatures from **Open-Meteo** (monthly +
  daily), geocoded from your service address, with **heating/cooling degree-days (HDD/CDD)**
  and **weather-normalized** usage so a cold snap doesn't look like waste.
- **Next-bill estimate.** Projects your next bill's **cost** from recent usage × current
  rates, with a confidence band. It's an estimate — never stored, never feeds verification.
- **Multiple accounts.** Discovers every billing account behind a login and gives you a
  **switcher**; charts and exports follow the selected account.
- **Encrypted credential store.** Save National Grid logins **AES-256-GCM-encrypted at rest**
  (key from `NGRID_SECRET_KEY`, or auto-generated and persisted on first run). **Interactive
  MFA/OTP** login + re-authentication, safe removal (keep or delete that account's data, with
  a password confirm), and a `needs_reauth` status when a session goes stale. Env creds remain
  the bootstrap/fallback; a password is never logged or returned to the browser.
- **Export & download.** **CSV export** of the series and bills, and **bulk PDF download** of
  any bill date range as a **zip** (Windows/macOS) or **tgz** (Linux).
- **New-bill notifications.** Off by default; on a *scheduled* check that finds a new bill,
  fire exactly one notification via **webhook / ntfy / SMTP**.
- **Gentle scheduler.** Polls only **near the predicted bill date** (predicted ± a window
  sized from your historical bill spacing), idle otherwise — easy on National Grid.
- **Cockpit UI.** A responsive single-screen layout (no page scroll on a 16:9 desktop,
  collapses to mobile), **paginated chart panels**, a **visual month/year range picker** with
  presets driving every view, per-chart customization, a **live scrape-progress** banner, and
  the running app **version** in the header + Settings.
- **Safe upgrades.** A **pre-upgrade `pg_dump` backup** (fail-closed) before any
  schema-changing deploy, plus CI that gates every merge on the unit tests **and** a
  migration-safety job proving an upgrade preserves seeded data.

## Quick start (Docker)

You need Docker + the Docker Compose plugin. **No clone or build required** — just grab
two files (the compose file pulls the prebuilt image from GHCR):

```bash
mkdir ngrid-dashboard && cd ngrid-dashboard
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/delabrcd/ngrid-dashboard/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -fsSL  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/delabrcd/ngrid-dashboard/main/.env.example -o .env
# edit .env: set a DB_PASSWORD (and the matching password in DATABASE_URL)
nano .env
docker compose up -d
```

(Or download `docker-compose.yml` + `.env.example` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/delabrcd/ngrid-dashboard/releases/latest).)

Open **http://localhost:3000** and **add your National Grid login in the browser** —
the first-run setup walks you through it (including the **OTP/MFA** step), stores the
password **encrypted at rest**, and auto-generates the encryption key. No National Grid
credentials in `.env` required. Update later with `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`.

> **Why a `DB_PASSWORD` is still the one thing you set in `.env`:** Postgres isn't exposed
> to your network, but the app and the database container still have to agree on a password.
> Everything else — your National Grid login and the credential-store key — is handled in the
> browser on first run. A fully `.env`-free quickstart is tracked in
> [issue #56](https://github.com/delabrcd/ngrid-dashboard/issues/56).
>
> Prefer to pre-seed the login (e.g. for an unattended install)? The **env path is still
> supported**: set `NGRID_USER` / `NGRID_PASS` in `.env` and they bootstrap the encrypted
> store on first start (you may still need the UI for an OTP). See [Configuration](#configuration-env).

**Building from source instead** (developers): clone the repo, then
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml up -d --build`.

### Image tags

The image is published to **`ghcr.io/delabrcd/ngrid-dashboard`** by CI:

| Tag | Points at |
|---|---|
| `latest` | the newest tagged release (what `docker compose` pulls by default) |
| `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `X` | a specific [semver](https://semver.org) release (e.g. `0.1.0`, `0.1`, `0`) |
| `edge` | the current `main` branch |
| `sha-xxxxxxx` | the exact commit of any build |

Pin a release for reproducibility by setting `image: ghcr.io/delabrcd/ngrid-dashboard:0.1.0`
in your compose file.

**Cutting a release = publishing a GitHub Release.** The release creates the tag and drives
the build; the version is derived from the release tag (no manual `package.json` bump):

```bash
gh release create v0.1.1 --generate-notes
```

(or GitHub UI → Releases → *Draft a new release* → choose a new tag `vX.Y.Z` → *Publish*).
CI then publishes `0.1.1`/`0.1`/`0` and moves `:latest`. (Each release is also gated on the
unit tests and a migration-safety check — see [Accuracy & tests](#accuracy--tests).) The app
shows the running version in its header and Settings (`vX.Y.Z` for releases,
`0.0.0-edge.<sha>` for `main`/`edge` builds). Once you've added your login, the first
run logs in, downloads your whole history and every PDF (a couple of minutes), then the
charts fill in. After that it keeps itself up to date automatically.

### Configuration (`.env`)

**Only `DB_PASSWORD` (and the matching password in `DATABASE_URL`) is required** — everything
else is optional. Your National Grid login and the encryption key are handled in the browser on
first run (see [Quick start](#quick-start-docker)); set them here only if you want to pre-seed an
unattended install. Full reference + comments live in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

| Var | What |
|---|---|
| `DB_PASSWORD` | **Required.** Any long random string (used for the bundled Postgres). |
| `DATABASE_URL` | **Required.** Pre-filled to point at the `ngrid_postgres` container — change the password to match `DB_PASSWORD`. |
| `NGRID_USER` / `NGRID_PASS` | **Optional.** Your National Grid email + password. Leave unset and add the login in the browser instead; set them to **pre-seed/bootstrap** (e.g. unattended installs) — on first start they're imported into the encrypted store, with env as the ongoing fallback. |
| `APP_PORT` | Host port for the UI (default 3000) |
| `TZ` | Your timezone, e.g. `America/New_York` |
| `PDF_DIR` | Host path for bill PDFs (default `./data/pdfs`) |
| `SCHEDULER_ENABLED` | `false` to disable automatic checking (manual button only); also toggleable in Settings |
| `NGRID_SECRET_KEY` | **Optional.** Key for the **encrypted credential store** (AES-256-GCM). Leave unset and one is **auto-generated** and persisted under the session volume on first run; set it (`openssl rand -base64 32`) to **override** the auto-generated key with your own. The key is **never** stored in the DB. |
| `NOTIFY_CHANNEL` + channel vars | New-bill notifications (off by default): `webhook` (`NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL`), `ntfy` (`NTFY_URL`/`NTFY_TOPIC`/`NTFY_TOKEN`), or `smtp` (`SMTP_HOST`/`SMTP_PORT`/`SMTP_USER`/`SMTP_PASS`/`SMTP_FROM`/`SMTP_TO`). Leave `NOTIFY_CHANNEL` unset to infer from whichever block you fill in. |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | Public URL of this dashboard, used to build the link in a notification |
| `BACKUP_DIR` / `BACKUP_BEFORE_MIGRATE` / `BACKUP_RETENTION` | Pre-upgrade DB backups (default `./data/backups`, on, keep newest 10) — see [Data & volumes](#data--volumes) |

## How it works

- **Scraper** (`app/src/lib/ngrid/`) drives a headless Chromium (bundled in the
  image). It logs in through National Grid's Azure AD B2C flow once, then **reuses the
  session** so it rarely needs to log in again. It reads your data by intercepting the
  portal's *own* API calls and widening their date filters — so it stays aligned with
  whatever the site returns and keeps the site's auth intact. A login can fan out to
  **multiple billing accounts**; each is scraped and selectable in the UI.
- **Login store**: National Grid logins are saved **AES-256-GCM-encrypted** in the DB
  (`NgLogin`), with **interactive MFA/OTP** when a login needs it. Env creds are the
  bootstrap/fallback when no stored login exists.
- **Database**: Postgres, schema in `app/prisma/schema.prisma`. On startup the app syncs the
  schema (`prisma db push`); before any schema-changing upgrade it takes a fail-closed
  `pg_dump` backup first.
- **Weather**: full bill-history temperatures from **Open-Meteo** (monthly + daily),
  geocoded from your service address, used for the weather charts and **degree-day**
  (HDD/CDD) weather-normalization.
- **Scheduler**: predicts your next statement date from the spacing of past bills and only
  checks **near that date** (predicted ± a window sized from your historical bill spacing),
  staying idle otherwise. Can optionally **notify** you (webhook / ntfy / SMTP) when a
  scheduled check finds a new bill.
- **Dashboard**: Next.js + Recharts — a responsive single-screen cockpit with a month/year
  range picker, paginated chart panels, CSV export, bulk-PDF download, and a next-bill cost
  estimate.

## Accuracy & tests

The numbers are validated two ways, because an API value can be plausible but wrong:

- **Hand-calculated unit tests** (`app/test/`, [vitest](https://vitest.dev)) cover the PDF
  charge parser, the rate math (supply / all-in / 12-month average), and bill-date
  prediction with values worked out by hand. **CI runs them on every PR/push and gates the
  image build on them** (plus a migration-safety job that proves a schema upgrade preserves
  data on a seeded copy of the previous release). Run them yourself:
  ```bash
  docker build --target test -t ngrid-test ./app && docker run --rm ngrid-test
  ```
- **Cross-validation against the actual bills.** The bill PDF is the source of truth, so
  `GET /api/verify` (or **Settings → Verify all bills**) re-parses every PDF and asserts
  the stored/API numbers match it: bill total, kWh/therms usage, and the supply/delivery
  breakdown, plus internal consistency (supply + delivery + other = current charges) and
  that the statement *Amount Due* = current charges + any carried-over balance.

  This caught a real issue: the API's bill `totalDueAmount` is the statement **Amount
  Due** (which can include a carried-over balance or late fees), *not* the period's
  energy cost. The dashboard uses the PDF's **Total Current Charges** for all cost and
  rate analysis so carryovers don't distort your numbers.

## Security & etiquette — please read

- **There is no built-in login.** The dashboard shows your financial data to anyone who
  can reach the port. Keep it on your LAN, or put it behind a reverse proxy / VPN /
  SSO. **Do not expose port 3000 to the public internet.**
- When you add your login through the UI (the default path), the password is **encrypted at
  rest (AES-256-GCM)** in the DB; the key (auto-generated, or from `NGRID_SECRET_KEY`) lives
  only in the session volume, never in the DB, and a decrypted password is never logged or
  returned to the browser. If you instead pre-seed credentials in `.env`, keep it private
  (`chmod 600 .env`).
- The in-app login-management UI is **not** a public auth layer — it inherits the same access
  gate (LAN / reverse proxy / SSO) and must never expose financial data un-gated.
- The saved Playwright login **session** (live auth tokens) lives in a root-only Docker volume
  (`0600`), not in your working directory.
- This automates access to **your own account** for personal use. Be gentle: the app
  reuses its session and rate-limits checks to avoid hammering National Grid. Automated
  access may be against National Grid's Terms of Service — use at your own risk.
- **MFA/OTP** is supported **interactively** when you set up or re-authenticate a login in the
  UI. The **unattended scheduler** can't answer an OTP prompt, so a login that always demands
  MFA can't be auto-refreshed (it surfaces a clear status).

## Data & volumes

- **Postgres** → Docker named volume `pgdata` (managed by Docker; no host-permission
  surprises). Back up with `docker compose exec ngrid_postgres pg_dump -U ngrid ngrid > backup.sql`.
- **Login session + secret key** → Docker named volume `session` (sensitive: holds live auth
  tokens, so it's kept in a root-only volume, `0600`, out of your working directory — not a
  bind mount). If you don't set `NGRID_SECRET_KEY`, the auto-generated credential-store key is
  persisted here too (`session/secret.key`, `0600`) — keep this volume to keep your stored
  logins decryptable.
- **Bill PDFs** → a host directory, `./data/pdfs/<account>/<date>.pdf` by default; point
  `PDF_DIR` at any path (e.g. a NAS) in `.env`.
- **Pre-upgrade DB backups** → a host directory, `./data/backups` by default (`BACKUP_DIR`).
  Before applying a schema-changing upgrade, the app `pg_dump`s the database here (one
  gzipped dump per upgrade, newest `BACKUP_RETENTION` kept) so there's always a restore
  point — and it refuses to apply the change if that backup can't be written. Restore one
  with:
  ```bash
  gunzip -c ./data/backups/ngrid-pre-migrate-<stamp>.sql.gz \
    | docker compose exec -T ngrid_postgres psql -U ngrid -d ngrid
  ```

To get PDFs out of the container if you change the mount: `docker compose cp ngrid_dashboard:/data/pdfs ./pdfs`.

To wipe everything and start over: `docker compose down -v` (removes the named volumes), then
delete your PDF directory.
